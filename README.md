The analysis is based on data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones/version/1
For this project, the pandas, numpy and seaborn packages were used.

This analysis answers the following questions:
* Did winter help the Starks to win their battles?
* Characteristics of deaths?
* What is the distribution of characters lifespan in term of chapters?

The analysis concludes that
* Winter did **not** help the Stakrs win any wars
* Males had an unproportional tendency of dying, compared to the general gender distribution in the universe
* Most character die very few chapters after their introduction.
