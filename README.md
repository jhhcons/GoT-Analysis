# GoT-Analysis
Analysis of Game of Thrones dataset. Made for Udacity Nano Degree.

The analysis is based on data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones/version/1
For this project, the pandas, numpy and seaborn packages were used.

This analysis answers the following questions:
* Did winter help the Starks to win their battles?
* Characteristics of deaths?
* What is the distribution of characters lifespan in term of chapters?

The analysis concludes that
* Winter did **not** help the Starks win any wars
* Males had an unproportional tendency of dying, compared to the general gender distribution in the universe
* Most character die very few chapters after their introduction.

The following files are present in this project:
* GoT Analysis.ipynb - The Jupiter Notebook containing the analysis
* README.md - This Readme
* battles.csv - Battle data
* character-deaths.csv - Character death specific information
* character-predictions.csv - Base information about the differnet characters in the Universe, along with a prediction of likelyhood of death.
